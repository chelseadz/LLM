Fortunately I don't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people close to that region).

No, not with me, the (in my opinion) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, sure, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context.<br /><br />This movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still keeps coming back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel \"lover\" on the line, an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle (she is the \"official replacement\" of his ex wife), a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super-annoying.<br /><br />After having seen it you feel almost nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or feel like doing anything... Maybe that's why I gave it 7 points, it made me react in a way I never reacted before.

The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the\n","> madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms\n","> convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he\n","> understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also\n","> Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful\n","> and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life\n","> underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish\n","> fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning\n","> or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples'\n","> tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to\n","> other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals\n","> how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a\n","> crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the\n","> world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he\n","> arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from\n","> fiction.

One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink,\n","> Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now\n","> has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is\n","> full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their\n","> relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's\n","> sake.

But\n","> then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the\n","> pieces together, which will blow many minds away.<br /><br />There are two\n","> great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and\n","> a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been\n","> shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future\n","> self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him.
